Simple and fast Julia implementation of Krylov subspace methods for linear systems.

## Goals and Guidelines

The main goal of this package is to derive simple and fast implementation of the most useful Krylov subspace methods. 

Our main objectives are:
- **speed**: where try to minimize allocation costs and maximize the use of BLAS routines,
- **memory efficiency**: storing temporary variables and re-allocations are avoided,
- **generality**: where possible complex systems are supported,
- **reliability**: unit tests are provided.
